# Lux AI (Season 2 / NeurIPS) — reading map for Orbit Wars

Lux is **1v1 multi-unit resource RTS** on Kaggle with a mature SDK and public top solutions. Mechanics differ from Orbit Wars (grid/tiles vs continuous orbit), but **macro allocation, opponent modeling, and time-budgeted search** transfer well.

## Map to this repo (`orbit_wars_bot/`)

| Lux idea | Orbit Wars hook |
|----------|------------------|
| Macro “where to invest next” | `allocation/scoring.py` — planet value, threat, ETA |
| Unit assignment under cap | `GameState` + multi-source sends in `submission_v6.py` |
| Rollout / limited-depth search | `simulation/forward.py` |
| RL for policy | `orbit_wars_bot/rl/` — start with **macro parameters** or **discrete src×dst on top-K** |

### Checklist

- [ ] Skim Lux-S2-public `src` layout for scoring vs simulation split.
- [ ] Read one competition postmortem on **time limits** (parallel to `actTimeout` 1s in Orbit Wars).
